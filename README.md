# a-to-z-deep-learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that is inspired by the structure of a human brain.

Deep Learning Algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given logical structure called a Neural Network.
### There are different types of Neural Networks:

**ANN:** **Artificial Neural Networks**. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in many fields for classification tasks, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling and have proved to deliver excellent performance on such data.

**CNN: Convolutional Neural Network** is a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images. A CNN is a powerful tool but requires millions of labeled data points for training. it's good for the image.

**RNN: Recurrent Neural Network** is a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential data or time series data. it’s working well on space and textual data.

**GAN: Generative Adversarial Network** is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other by using deep learning methods to become more accurate in their predictions. gan are generating text, images, etc.
